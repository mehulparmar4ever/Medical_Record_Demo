**[Magical Record](https://github.com/magicalpanda/MagicalRecord) was inspired by the ease of Ruby on Rails' Active Record fetching. The goals of this code are:**
* Clean up my Core Data related code
* Allow for clear, simple, one-line fetches
* Still allow the modification of the NSFetchRequest when request optimizations are needed
